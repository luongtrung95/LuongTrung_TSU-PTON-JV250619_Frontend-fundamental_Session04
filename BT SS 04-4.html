        A<b> website</b> (also written as a <b>web site</b>) is any <span class="text-blue">web pages</span> and related content that
      is identified by a common <span class="text-blue">domain name</span> and published on at least one
      <span class="text-blue">web server.</span>
      Websites are typically dedicated to a particular topic or purpose, such as news, education, commerce,
      entertainment, or <span class="text-blue">social media. Hyperlinking</span> between web pages guides the
      navigation of the site, which often starts with a <span class="text-blue">home page.</span> The
      <span class="text-blue">most-visited</span> sites are <span class="text-blue">Google, YouTube</span>, and
      <span class="text-blue">Facebook.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      All publicly-accessible websites collectively constitute the <span class="text-blue">World Wide Web.</span> There
      are also private websites that can only be accessed on a <span class="text-blue"> private network</span>, such as a
      company's internal website for its employees. <span class="text-blue">Users</span> can access websites on a range of devices, including
      <span class="text-blue">desktops, laptops, tablets</span>, and <span class="text-blue">smartphones</span>. The <span class="text-blue">app
      </span>used on these devices is called a <span class="text-blue">web browser</span>.
